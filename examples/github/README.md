# GitHub rollout example

In this example, you can see the GitHub Action YML in [.github/workflows/github-integration-test.yml](../.github/workflows/github-integration-test.yml) that you could add to your GitHub repo to trigger deployments.

The GitHub YML creates an OIDC token and uses that to authenticate to the rollout service.
